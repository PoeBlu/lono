Lono has been written from years of experience and provides a workflow that makes CloudFormation much easier. Lono makes it possible to reuse CloudFormation templates. You can deploy the same templates across AWS accounts and build multiple environments.

Lono is available under a [Source Available license](https://www.boltops.com/boltops-community-license) and free to use.  You can download it from RubyGems. Give a spin and see if it's the right fit for you.

If you're using lono, all we ask is that you register. Registration allows lono to be ultimately improved. Registering also allows you to receive updates and special offers. Registration is free and straightforward. You can register at: [Register](https://register.lono.cloud)

Thanks for your support. Your support helps make lono software possible.
