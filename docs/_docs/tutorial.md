In the following sections, we'll walk through a tutorial where you will build a lono project the "hard" way from scratch. This will give you a chance to learn how lono works and experiment with the most commonly used lono commands. By the end, you will have successfully created and updated a CloudFormation stack with lono.

Once we are done building a project from scratch you will then do it all again in a single command with `lono new` command.

Finally, we'll show you how to take an existing CloudFormation template and add it to a lono project.

Let's start!
