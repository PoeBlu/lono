In the following sections we'll walk through a tutorial where you will build up a lono project from scratch. This will give you a chance to learn how lono works and experiment with the most commonly used lono commands. By the end you will have successfully created and updated a CloudFormation stack with lono.

Once we are done building up a project from scratch the tutorial show you how to more quickly build a lono project up with the `lono new` command.

Finally, we'll show you how to take an existing CloudFormation template and add it to a lono project.
