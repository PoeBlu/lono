title: Build with lono new
---

You do not have to start with an empty folder as your lono project. Normally, you use `lono new project-name` to generate a new lono project with the proper structure.  Example:

```
$ lono new infra
Setting up lono project
creating: infra/config/templates/base/stacks.rb
creating: infra/config/templates/prod/stacks.rb
creating: infra/config/templates/stag/stacks.rb
creating: infra/config/variables/base/variables.rb
creating: infra/config/variables/prod/variables.rb
creating: infra/config/variables/stag/variables.rb
already exists: infra/Gemfile
already exists: infra/Guardfile
creating: infra/helpers/my_custom_helper.rb
creating: infra/params/base/api-web-prod.txt
creating: infra/params/base/example.txt
creating: infra/params/prod/example.txt
creating: infra/params/stag/example.txt
creating: infra/templates/db.yml
creating: infra/templates/example.yml
creating: infra/templates/partial/host_record.yml
creating: infra/templates/partial/server.yml
creating: infra/templates/partial/user_data/bootstrap.sh
creating: infra/templates/web.yml
Starter lono project created
$
```

As you can see `lono new` creates a starter project for you with a few example templates.  This is a much quicker way to get up and running!  You can launch the same example template that we previously walked through immediately after using `lono new`.

```sh
$ lono cfn create example
```

The new project generated by lono has other templates to demonstrate the different ways of using ERB templates in lono.
