title: Delete the Stack
---

Now it is time to clean up the resources.  You can delete the stack with the following command:

```sh
$ lono cfn delete example
Are you sure you want to want to delete the stack? (y/N)
y
Deleted example stack.
$
```

Lono prompts with an "Are you sure?" message before the stack gets deleted.  If you would like to bypass the prompt, you can use the `--sure` flag.

```
$ lono cfn delete example --sure
Deleted example stack.
$
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully created a lono project from scratch!
