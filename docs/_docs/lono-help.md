title: Lono Help
---

You can run help for quick help information right at the cli.  Example:

```sh
lono help
```

You can append `help`, `-h` or `--help` to the end of any command to get more help information about that specific command.  These all work.

```sh
lono docker build help
lono ship --help
lono ships -h
```
