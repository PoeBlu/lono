Congratulations!  You have successfully created a CloudFormation stack with lono. It was really that simple üòÅ

### lono cfn summary

Lono provides a `lono cfn` management command that allows you to launch stacks from the generated lono templates. The `lono cfn` tool automatically runs `lono generate` internally and then launches the CloudFormation stack in a single command. Provided that you are in a lono project and have a `my-stack` lono template definition. To create a stack you can simply run::

```
$ lono cfn create my-stack
```

The above command will generate files to `output/prod/my-stack.json` and `output/params/prod/my-stack.txt` and use them to create a CloudFormation stack. Here are some more examples of cfn commands::

```
$ lono cfn create mystack-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) --template mystack --params mystack
$ lono cfn create mystack-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) # shorthand if template and params file matches.
$ lono cfn diff mystack-1493859659
$ lono cfn preview mystack-1493859659
$ lono cfn update mystack-1493859659
$ lono cfn delete mystack-1493859659
$ lono cfn create -h # getting help
```
