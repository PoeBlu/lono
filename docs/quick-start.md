In a hurry? No problem!  Here's a quick start to using lono that takes only a few minutes.  The commands below launches a CloudFormation stack.  It's that simple.

{% highlight bash %}
brew tap boltopslabs/boltops
brew cask install bolts
lono new infra
cd infra
lono cfn create example
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the newly launch stack in the AWS console:
