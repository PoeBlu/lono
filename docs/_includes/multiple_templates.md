## Multiple Templates?

Templates belong to a blueprint. Another way of putting is that each blueprint can have many templates.

While it is possible to create multiple templates for a blueprint, it is generally recommended to create only one template for each blueprint. This allows you to take advantage of the [Lono CLI naming conventions]({% link _docs/conventions/cli.md %}) and keep your commands short and simple.  You may find that it results in more focused blueprint code.
