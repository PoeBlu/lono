      # Can also use the AWS_PROFILE as the mapping

  randomize_stack_name: false # for lono cfn create. Tack on 3 random characters
    # at end of stack name. Helps launch multiple stacks with the same command.

development:
  # cluster: dev
  # When you have AWS_PROFILE set to one of these values, ufo will switch to the desired
  # environment. This prevents you from switching AWS_PROFILE, forgetting to
  # also switch UFO_ENV, and accidentally deploying to production vs development.
  # aws_profiles:
  #   - dev_profile1
  #   - dev_profile2

production:
  # cluster: prod
  # aws_profiles:
  #   - prod_profile
