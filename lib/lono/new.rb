        Congrats ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully created a lono project.  A starter demo blueprint was created
        and is at blueprints/demo.  Check things out by going into the created infra folder.

          cd #{project_name}

        To generate the blueprint templates without launching a stack, you can run:

          lono generate demo

        The generated files are created at `output/demo/templates` and `output/demo/params`.

        To deploy the CloudFormation stack:

          lono cfn deploy my-demo --blueprint demo

        If you name the stack according to conventions, you can simply run:

          lono cfn deploy demo

        To list and create additional blueprints refer to https://lono.cloud/docs/core/blueprints
